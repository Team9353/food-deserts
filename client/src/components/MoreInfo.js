                    <p>The USDA’s formal definition of food security stresses
                        "ready availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods”
                        that can be obtained in socially acceptable ways. The concept
                        of a food desert is used to highlight how food insecurity affects
                        people along the lines of community and geography.</p>
