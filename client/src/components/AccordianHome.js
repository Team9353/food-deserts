                        If you are in a food desert, you will likely struggle
                        to find healthy foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole
                        grains. Food deserts often have convenience stores and
                        gas stations instead of regular grocery stores.

                        Studies show up to 20% of Americans live in food
                        deserts. Nearly 2 million Georgia residents,
                        including about 500,000 children, live in food deserts,
                        according to an Atlanta Journal Constitution
                        investigation found <a
