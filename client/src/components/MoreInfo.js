            <h3> What is the official definition of a food desert? </h3>
            The USDA’s formal definition of food security stresses
            "ready availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods”
            that can be obtained in socially acceptable ways. The concept
            of a food desert is used to highlight how food insecurity affects
            people along the lines of community and geography.

            <br></br>

            <h3> Problems related to current solutions for food deserts</h3>

            - Educational materials regarding food security and food justice
            are often lackluster, lacking in readability level and
            cultural relevance.

            <br></br>
            <br></br>


            - Ineffective food security interventions can end up becoming
            another barrier to food security.

            <br></br>
            <br></br>

            - Food assistance programs alone have not been effective
            because they do not address the problem of food insecurity
            at the level of its most widely agreed upon cause: poverty.

            <br></br>

            <h3>What Is The Breadth Of Food Insecurity?</h3>

            People at the highest risk include low-income women and
            low-income communities, communities of color, young mothers,
            the elderly, immigrants, poor rural families, and children.

            <h3>What Are The Effects Of Food Insecurity?</h3>

            - People living in food deserts are also more likely to be
            living in poverty and facing significant barriers to accessing
            quality healthcare, education, and employment.

            <br></br>
            <br></br>

            - Food insecurity directly causes physical health problems because
            malnutrition decimates immunity to diseases and toxic substances.

            <br></br>
            <br></br>

            - The damage of food insecurity is compounded for children and
            the elderly. Both have a critical need for balanced nutrition.
